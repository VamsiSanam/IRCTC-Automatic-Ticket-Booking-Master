# IRCTC-Automatic-Ticket-Booking-Master
This repository demonstrates how to book IRCTC Tatkal tickets with ease using powerful RPA tool - UiPath

## Brief background:
Currently booking a Tatkal ticket through IRCTC is a very tedious and time-consuming job. 
There are many challenges faced by a user, from server downtime or timeouts to poor network connectivity. 
Even after having logged in, it takes time to fill data, navigate through all the forms and make payment to complete the booking. 

As Lakhs of people try to book tickets every day, for a user to get confirmed tickets is no easy task as tickets are sold out in minutes. Many are forced to pay an exponential fare for premium tatkal.

Our solution template using RPA's UiPath is aimed at addressing this issue. We as a team of certified RPA's UiPath developers, aim to improve userâ€™s experience by automating mundane but important tasks. Booking Tatkal tickets is as simple as filling a simple XLS file and our solution will take care of the rest!.
